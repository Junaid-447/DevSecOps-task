# Prerequisites
Before using this Terraform code, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

* [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads) installed on your local machine.
* An Azure subscription and the necessary authentication credentials.
* Customization of variables in the **variables.tf** file to match your environment.

# Folder Structure
The folder structure of this Terraform project is organized as follows:

* **main.tf**: The main Terraform configuration file containing resource definitions for the resource group, storage account, and storage container.
* **variables.tf**: Variables and their descriptions, which can be customized to configure the state backend.
* **outputs.tf**: Output variables that provide information about the provisioned Azure resources.
* **README.md**: This documentation file.

# Variables
Customize the variables in the variables.tf file to configure the state backend according to your Azure environment. The variables include details about the resource group, storage account, and container names.

# Terraform Configuration
In the main.tf file, you will find the Terraform configuration for provisioning Azure resources for the state backend. This includes the definition of a resource group, a storage account, and a storage container.

# Terraform State Backend
Once you have applied the Terraform configuration, the provisioned Azure Storage Account and Container will be used as the backend to store Terraform state files. To use this remote state backend in your other Terraform configurations, add the following block to your Terraform files:

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "azurerm" {
    resource_group_name   = var.tfstate_resource_group_name
    storage_account_name  = var.tfstate_storage_account_name
    container_name        = var.tfstate_container
    key                   = "terraform.tfstate"
  }
}
```
Replace **var.tfstate_resource_group_name**, **var.tfstate_storage_account_name**, and **var.tfstate_container** with your customized values.
