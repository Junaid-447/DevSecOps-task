* [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads) installed on your local machine.
* An Azure subscription and the necessary authentication credentials.
* Customization of variables in the **variables.tf** file to match your environment.

# Folder Structure
The folder structure of this Terraform project is organized as follows:

* **main.tf**: The main Terraform configuration file containing resource definitions for the resource group, storage account, and storage container.
* **variables.tf**: Variables and their descriptions, which can be customized to configure the state backend.
* **outputs.tf**: Output variables that provide information about the provisioned Azure resources.
* **README.md**: This documentation file.

# Variables
Customize the variables in the code snippet according to your requirements. In this code snippet, the variables include:

1. **var.app_gateway_name**: The name of the Azure Application Gateway to create.
2. **var.resource_group_name**: The name of the Azure Resource Group where the Application Gateway and associated resources should be created.
3. **var.location**: The Azure region where the Application Gateway should be deployed.

Various configuration options for the Application Gateway, such as SKU, listener settings, backend pool, and more.

# Terraform Configuration
This code snippet defines an Azure Application Gateway and its associated resources using Terraform's azurerm provider:

1. **azurerm_subnet**: Defines a subnet within an existing virtual network for the Application Gateway.

2. **azurerm_public_ip**: Defines a public IP address for the Application Gateway.

3. **azurerm_application_gateway**: Defines the Azure Application Gateway itself, including its SKU, frontend configuration, listener, backend pool, probe, and routing rules.

The Application Gateway is configured to route incoming traffic based on URL paths, and it includes settings for SSL termination, probe health checks, and other common Application Gateway features.
